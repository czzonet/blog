Blog in github


As I write articles using md on my own website,so I concerned that why not I publish with github?As github also support md,it could be realy easy to migrate files to github.

As far as I am concerned,both personal website and github have their own advantages which personal website may have more self design and can be more dynamic.But as using md,which make writing articles with style more convinent,it could be just same in show.But also you can add animation between article loading from another.

Last but not the least,I am running process on building website and still learning front-end skills for better effort of show. So as for now,it could be a good idea to put articles in github just for backup or something else.
